# python-api-challenge
This challenge is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.
- WeatherPy: Through Python script to visualise the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator.
             Four pairs of plots and linear regression to showcase the relationship between weather variables (Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, Wind Speed) and Latitude
             Summary of findings after each set of visualisations.
- VacationPy: Based on the output of cities file, use the Geoapify API and geoViews Python library to create map visualisations.
              Narrow down the DataFrame to find the ideal cities with satisfying certain conditions.
              Use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of the coordinates and display with the country in the final map.
